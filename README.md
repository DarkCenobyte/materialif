##Why another forum?


Well, if you look at others forum, theres is many that aren't free, and there is phpBB and its clone (punBB, ...), I wanted to do something different, and also more modern... I also wanted to be more free that can be phpBB, by refusing use a framework like Symphony or Laravel, but doing the rendering, the controller loading, securities, ... from scratch using what PHP give us and do fast.

I choose Smarty 3 for performance, I choose Eloquent because I want a great ORM to make my models and database storage support multiple types of databases, and also make clean usage of my models.

In some way, I keep in mind I want my forum to be easy to use for developpers a framework would be, so I will keep my controllers and models as generic as possible and prepare some skeleton for modulable extensions.
